# **Getting Started**
The following repository contains the non ML project 27 of the CM course.<br />

# Prerequisites
Given N the number of nodes and E the number of edges of the graph, the instances we use come from a `.txt` file and have the following structure: the first N rows are formatted like that: `'n' | node | supply`, while the rows from the (N+1)-th to the last (E+N) have this format: `'a' | source_node | destinatation_node | cost`.<br />

# Execution
