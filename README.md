# **How to use it**

The function `init_customGMRES(A, b, c, D, E)` is the main function that plots the solutions of the customGMRES with different Arnoldi iterations `[50, 100, 200, 500]` and even the solutions using the `lsqr()` function already written in MATLAB with different iterations `[500, 1000, 2000]`. <br /> <br />
In the folder `data` there are the matrices A, D, E whose dimensions are `5000 x 5000` and the vectors b and c whose dimensions are `5000 x 1`. So the matrix A will be a matrix with dimensions `10000 x 10000`.
